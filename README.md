The European Joint Research Center seeks to identify field boundaries across the European Union and use crowd sourced data to determine agricultural data for these fields; "Ultimately, the resulting datasets shopuld serve as  parcel-level ground-truth for Copernicus Sentinel-1 and-2 based EO products."

The essensce of the effort is to create both boundaries and seasonally accurate data about the plantings in those fields. It could be thought of as a combination of OneSoil field boundary extraction combined with more accurate machine learning based extraction of crop typing.

OneSoil has created beautiful field boundary maps:

But, their crop data is not always accurate:

Other efforts such as EuroSat have created datasets for machine learning based on image chips, but not for labeled extraction of crop types. 

How can these both be combined?

LUCAS offers these types of images:
